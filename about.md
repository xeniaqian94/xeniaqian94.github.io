Hey there, welcome!   

I'm Xenia ['zi:niə],['zinɪə]. This English name was made from the actress *Xenia Goodwin* of my favorite drama *Dance Academy*, a drama that motivates me much during my teenage age. 

My Chinese name is Qian Xin (钱 昕). You may find it easy to pronounce as Chien Hsin ;D. Xin is my first name, which has the meaning of [Dawn] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawn), the time when the sun rises.

I love both my English name and my Chinese name because the meaning in them are positive, even beyond their original language and transcend different cultures. 

I am currently an undergraduate student in [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn), studying Software Engineering, graduating in 2017. I was exchanged to [the University of Hong Kong](http://www.hku.hk), in the year of 2014-2015, studying Computer Science. [Continuing..]

Since secondary school, Math and Programming have interested my a lot. The story of [Ada Lovelace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace), the first female Computer Scientist, also inspired me while learning.
